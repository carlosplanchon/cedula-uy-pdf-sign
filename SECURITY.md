# Security Policy

FirmaUY signs documents with the Uruguayan national ID card and handles the card's PIN. Security
reports are taken seriously, within the limits of a community project. Thank you for reporting
responsibly.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public issue or pull request for a security problem.

Report it privately through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

- Go to <https://github.com/carlosplanchon/firmauy/security/advisories/new>, or the repository's
  **Security** tab, then **Report a vulnerability**.
- If that is not possible, email **carlosplanchon@cognitialabs.com** with `[SECURITY]` in the
  subject.

Include what you can: a description, steps to reproduce, a proof of concept, the affected version
and your assessment of the impact. Reports in Spanish or English are equally welcome.

## What counts

Especially relevant areas, in rough order of severity:

- **Verification bypass**: anything that makes `verify` (or the verify commands) report VALID for
  a signature that should not validate, including trust-chain validation flaws.
- **Signature forgery or misuse** of the signing paths.
- **PIN exposure**: any path that lands the PIN in argv, logs, files, exception text or results,
  or that spends card PIN retries in unexpected ways.
- **Card damage**: native-mode APDU sequences that could block or corrupt the card.
- **Release integrity**: anything affecting the supply chain of the `firmauy` package on PyPI.

Out of scope here (report upstream instead):

- The cédula card or its applet, AGESIC services, and the official validator.
- The proprietary PKCS#11 middleware.
- The cédula driver inside OpenSC: report through
  [OpenSC's security process](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/security).
- Issues that require an already-compromised machine.

## What to expect

This is a community project with a single maintainer, so the process is honest rather than
corporate:

- Acknowledgment within **7 days**.
- An assessment and, when confirmed, a fix released as soon as practical, coordinated with you.
- Public disclosure through a GitHub security advisory once a fix is available, with credit to
  the reporter unless you prefer otherwise.

Only the **latest release on PyPI** receives security fixes.

FirmaUY is experimental and not officially certified (see the README's legal section). That
context does not lower the bar: a verification bypass or PIN exposure is treated as critical.
