# Security invariants of the verifiers

How the verification side of firmauy is tested against hostile and damaged input, stated as
invariants: the risk each one controls, the clause of Agesic's Marco de Ciberseguridad (MCU 5.0)
it speaks to, the tests that enforce it, and the counterexamples that were actually found on the
way here. Current as of firmauy 1.14.0.

Agesic's audit guidance for requirement AD.1 lists this category of evidence by name:
"Documentación de pruebas de seguridad, criterios de aceptación y entregables vinculados a
requisitos de seguridad". This page packages that evidence for the verifier. The format, a
traceability matrix, is this project's choice, not something the guidance prescribes.

## What this is, and what it is not

**It is** a traceability matrix, and together with the procedure below, a documented and
reproducible baseline: the measured state of the verifier's security testing at 1.14.0. Each row
connects one invariant to the risk it controls, the clause it speaks to, the tests that enforce
it, and the real defects found while getting there. Later audits, reviews and releases have this
to compare against.

**Quotes are verbatim, mappings are interpretation.** Text inside quotation marks is quoted
verbatim, in Spanish, from Agesic's published guidance or from the law. The mapping between an
invariant and a clause is this project's reading of where the evidence belongs, not a
determination by Agesic.

**It is not a compliance claim.** AD.1 and CA.4 describe an organisation's lifecycle and
controls, with maturity levels that presume an organisation around them. What this page shows is
narrower and checkable: the artifacts those clauses list as evidence exist here and can be
audited.

**It is not an audit.** Auditable is not audited. No external party has audited, certified or
otherwise assessed what this page describes. What the page does is lay the artifacts out so that
somebody could: every test is named, the procedure and its acceptance criteria are written down,
and every finding traces to a commit.

**It is not an accreditation, and cannot become one.** Under Ley 18.600, accreditation belongs
to certification service providers (the law's own words in art. 6 are "prestador de servicios de
certificación acreditado") and is granted by the UCE. A library is not a prestador. firmauy is
independent and unofficial, and a VALID from it is a technical assessment rather than a legal
one. The State-operated verification service is [firma.gub.uy](https://firma.gub.uy/).

## The clauses cited, verbatim

- **[CA.4 objetivo]** "Lograr el cumplimiento con los lineamientos establecidos por la UCE y
  Agesic para el uso de firma electrónica avanzada."
- **[CA.4 nivel 2]** "la solución incorpora medidas de detección de firmas alteradas o
  invalidadas, incluyendo trazabilidad del error"
- **[CA.4-10]** (nivel 4) "los sistemas deben permitir el uso de sellos de tiempo compatibles
  con RFC 3161"
- **[CA.4-11]** (nivel 4) "se realizan auditorías de los módulos de firma electrónica,
  incluyendo pruebas de cumplimiento de formatos, protocolos, protección de claves y servicios
  de sellado de tiempo"
- **[CA.4-12]** (nivel 4) "los resultados de las auditorías o revisiones son analizados e
  incorporados a la mejora de la solución y comunicados al RSI"
- **[AD.1 nivel 2]** "se sistematizan las actividades de prueba, incluyendo casos de prueba
  orientados a las validaciones de seguridad"
- **[AD.1 nivel 3]** "se define un procedimiento documentado de pruebas de seguridad" and "se
  definen los criterios de aceptación de los productos desde la perspectiva de seguridad"
- **[AD.1 evidencia]** "Documentación de pruebas de seguridad, criterios de aceptación y
  entregables vinculados a requisitos de seguridad"
- **[Ley 18.600 art. 6]** "El documento electrónico no hará fe respecto de su fecha, a menos que
  ésta conste a través de un fechado electrónico otorgado por un prestador de servicios de
  certificación acreditado."

## One definition the matrix leans on

A timestamp contributes a **usable validation time** only when every one of these holds:

```text
usable validation time =
    timestamp.present
    and timestamp.intact
    and timestamp.valid
    and timestamp.trusted is True
```

Only then does its `genTime` move the moment the signer's certificate is judged at (rows 4 and
7). In every other state, a `genTime` that can still be parsed is preserved and reported as
asserted evidence, and a token too damaged to state one reports `gen_time` as null. Neither is
allowed to affect the signer's validation. The implementation is `evaluate_timestamp` in
`src/firmauy/verify_common.py`, which returns a trusted time on that exact conjunction and on
nothing less.

## The matrix

All named tests run in CI with the normal suite (`uv run pytest`), which includes the properties
at their shallow profile, on every pull request and every push to main. The sweep and the deep
property profile run on the same trigger in their own job, and locally with `FIRMAUY_SWEEP=1`
and `FIRMAUY_DEEP=1`. Counterexample numbers (C1 to C7) refer to the section below. Unless a file
is named, tests live in [`tests/test_timestamp_status.py`](../tests/test_timestamp_status.py);
the others are [`test_xades_t.py`](../tests/test_xades_t.py),
[`test_properties_timestamp.py`](../tests/test_properties_timestamp.py) and
[`test_sweep_tstinfo.py`](../tests/test_sweep_tstinfo.py), and the job that runs them is in
[`ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml). Files rather than line numbers on purpose: a link to a
line is wrong the first time somebody edits above it, and a stale link in a page like this is
worse than none. The test names are exact, so `pytest -k` finds any of them.

Clause labels refer to the verbatim list above. **Limits** points at the numbered gap that bounds
a row, when one does; a dash means the row is stated no wider than what its tests hold.

## Counterexamples found

Each one was a real defect in released or reviewed code, reduced to a deterministic regression
before it was fixed, and traceable to the commit that fixed it. How each one surfaced is
recorded because it says something about which checks earn their keep, and for no other reason.
None of it is a credential: nobody external has assessed this code.

- **C1, VALID over a broken token** (before 1.12.0). PDF and CMS discarded pyHanko's
  `timestamp_validity` entirely, so a file whose token was broken in every way pyHanko reports
  still came back VALID with no row about it. Found by code review. Fixed in 1.12.0
  ([`1cf4689`](https://github.com/carlosplanchon/firmauy/commit/1cf4689), [`74efb50`](https://github.com/carlosplanchon/firmauy/commit/74efb50)). Regressions:
  `test_a_tampered_pdf_timestamp_holds_the_verdict_at_indeterminate` and its CMS twin, which
  edit the real unsigned attribute in the file.
- **C2, a sound token reported as destroyed** (before 1.12.1). XAdES answered integrity,
  validity and trust with one boolean, so a correct token under the wrong anchor came back
  `intact=False, valid=False` with its `genTime` erased, sending the reader to inspect the file
  when the problem was the anchors they passed. Found by code review. Fixed in 1.12.1
  ([`441b589`](https://github.com/carlosplanchon/firmauy/commit/441b589)). Regressions:
  `test_xades_t.py::test_a_sound_token_under_the_wrong_anchor_is_not_called_broken`,
  `test_xades_t.py::test_the_gen_time_survives_a_chain_that_did_not_validate`.
- **C3, decaying trust** (before 1.12.1). PDF and CMS judged the TSA's certificate at
  verification time instead of at `genTime`. Measured against a real DigiCert token: the same
  stamp read as trusted through 2036-09-03 and as untrusted from 2036-09-05, tracking the
  responder certificate's expiry to the day (found by bisection). Found by code review, confirmed by
  measurement. Fixed in 1.12.1 ([`441b589`](https://github.com/carlosplanchon/firmauy/commit/441b589)). Regressions:
  `test_a_pdf_timestamp_is_judged_at_gentime_and_not_at_verification_time` and its CMS twin.
- **C4, format asymmetry** (before 1.13.0). The same expired-signer, trusted-stamp scenario
  returned VALID as XAdES and INDETERMINATE as PDF or CMS. Found by cross-format measurement
  during development. Fixed in 1.13.0 ([`4c9084b`](https://github.com/carlosplanchon/firmauy/commit/4c9084b)). Regression:
  `test_the_three_formats_agree_about_an_expired_signer_with_a_trusted_stamp`.
- **C5, escaped exception on a malformed TSTInfo** (before 1.13.1). The extractor reported an
  unreadable token as absent, pyHanko then parsed the same bytes again, and the `ValueError`
  left a public function. Found by code review. Fixed in 1.13.1 ([`3ee3418`](https://github.com/carlosplanchon/firmauy/commit/3ee3418)). Regressions:
  `test_an_unreadable_token_does_not_take_the_whole_result_down` and its PDF twin.
- **C6, lazy parsing escape** (before 1.14.0). asn1crypto parses lazily, so damage anywhere past
  the first field read handed back a perfectly good `genTime`, was accepted, and raised later
  inside pyHanko. Found by the sweep below. Fixed in 1.14.0 ([`62c2fc2`](https://github.com/carlosplanchon/firmauy/commit/62c2fc2)). Regression:
  `test_damage_beyond_the_first_field_read_is_still_caught`.
- **C7, a digest nobody implements** (before 1.14.0). A structurally perfect OID naming a
  nonexistent hash algorithm parsed cleanly, was approved, and raised at first use.
  Structurally sound is not the same as usable. Found by the sweep below. Fixed in 1.14.0
  ([`62c2fc2`](https://github.com/carlosplanchon/firmauy/commit/62c2fc2)). Regression: `test_a_hash_nobody_implements_is_an_answer_and_not_a_crash`.

## The two searching checks

Most of the tests above answer a question somebody already thought to ask. Two do not: they
search. AD.1 nivel 3 asks for "un procedimiento documentado de pruebas de seguridad" and for
"criterios de aceptación de los productos desde la perspectiva de seguridad", and for the
timestamp parser these two sections are that procedure and those criteria.

They divide the work by whether the space can be walked. All three are finite. The sweep
enumerates, because 1096 cases is a number you can count to. The properties sample, because
theirs run to about 6x10^27 and 3.15x10^15, which are numbers you can only write down.

### The sweep: every single-bit mutation

1. Sign a detached `.p7s` with software keys and a local RFC 3161 timestamper. No card and no
   network are involved.
2. Locate the embedded TSTInfo, the timestamped structure inside the signature's unsigned
   attribute.
3. For every byte of it, and for every bit of that byte, flip exactly that one bit and verify
   the mutated file.
4. Acceptance criteria, all four for every mutation:
   - no exception escapes `verify_cms`,
   - the timestamp is reported present and not sound,
   - the overall indication is INDETERMINATE,
   - every check about the document's own signature stays green.
5. Any violation becomes a deterministic regression in `test_timestamp_status.py` before it is
   fixed, so the finding outlives the sweep that made it.

It runs in CI as the `sweep` job, on every pull request and every push to main, and locally
with:

```bash
FIRMAUY_SWEEP=1 uv run pytest tests/test_sweep_tstinfo.py -q
```

Last full run: firmauy 1.14.0, a 137 byte TSTInfo, 1096 single-bit mutations, zero violations,
25 seconds on a desktop machine. The two escapes it found (C6, C7) were in code that had been
reviewed three times and shipped with 385 passing deterministic tests, which is why it runs
continuously rather than sitting archived.

Two clauses of CA.4 nivel 4 describe this loop. [CA.4-11] asks for audits of the signature
modules "incluyendo pruebas de cumplimiento de formatos, protocolos, protección de claves y
servicios de sellado de tiempo". The sweep provides technical evidence relevant to the
timestamping side of such an audit and nothing more. What it demonstrates is robustness under
corruption, not conformance: broader format and protocol conformance, and key protection, are
outside its scope, and it is not itself an audit, independent or otherwise. [CA.4-12] asks for
audit results to be "analizados e incorporados a la mejora de la solución", and C1 to C7 show
that loop in practice, each finding folded back into the solution and traceable from defect to
commit to regression. Consistent with the clause, not a claim of compliance with it.

### The properties: what cannot be walked through

`tests/test_properties_timestamp.py`, using Hypothesis. The sweep counts to 1096 and stops. Two
spaces are finite too and nowhere near walkable, and there sampling is the only option:

- **Combined damage.** The unrestricted mutation space of a 137 byte structure is 2^1096. This
  property samples its two-to-twelve-flip subspace, about 6x10^27 sets. Each example draws
  between two and twelve flips and applies them together, and the acceptance criteria are the
  sweep's four, unchanged. When a property fails, Hypothesis
  shrinks the failure toward a smaller and simpler failing set, which is the part a loop cannot
  do. It searches for that rather than proving minimality, so a reported counterexample is small
  and not necessarily the smallest.
- **Time.** A hundred years at the microsecond resolution `timedelta` carries is about
  3.15x10^15 instants. Two properties sample it, over a signer certificate that expires the day
  after signing and a domain running from the genTime the token states out to a century. With a
  trusted timestamp the verdict must not depend on when you look, and with an unvalidated or
  wrongly anchored one the expired certificate must never be rescued. The second asserts on the
  chain row rather than on the indication, because an unvalidated token already holds the verdict
  at INDETERMINATE by itself and asserting on the word would pass either way. That trap was found
  in this suite by mutation testing, which is why it is called out here.

Two profiles: 50 examples with the normal suite across the whole Python matrix, and forty times
that once in the `sweep` job, both on every pull request and every push to main, and reachable
locally with `FIRMAUY_DEEP=1`. Keys and signed artifacts are built once per module and reused
for every example, because a 2048 bit RSA chain costs 1.76 seconds to generate and doing it per
example would buy nothing but wall clock.

The same rule as the sweep: any counterexample becomes a deterministic regression in
`test_timestamp_status.py` before it is fixed. Last deep run at 1.14.0: 6000 examples across the
three properties, no counterexamples, 3 minutes 15 seconds. Said plainly, because a reader is
otherwise left to guess, and because finding nothing is the honest expected result here: the
sweep had already enumerated the neighbourhood these properties extend outward from.

## Downstream

The three-valued semantics survive past this repository. firmauy-desktop asserts that a never
evaluated chain is not rendered as a failed one, and firmauy-mcp-inspect asserts that its batch
summary never collapses `trusted: null` into `false` and refuses to run on a CLI older than
these semantics. Both carry their own suites.

## Known gaps, in the order they should close

1. **Conformance against the official validator.** Everything above proves the verifier does not
   crash and does not misreport its own model. None of it proves the verdicts agree with
   [firma.gub.uy](https://firma.gub.uy/) on real cédula signatures, and that agreement is the
   first thing an institutional reviewer should ask about. Manual today.
2. **Revocation end to end.** Not re-confirmed against a live cédula signature, as recorded in
   [trust-anchors.md](trust-anchors.md).
3. **AdES -LT and -LTA are not implemented**, so a timestamp is judged optimistically at its own
   asserted `genTime`. Documented in [trust-anchors.md](trust-anchors.md) and [api.md](api.md).
4. **Coherent structural mutation is still out of reach.** Both searching checks preserve the
   size of the message: they flip bits, never insert, delete or re-nest. They do corrupt ASN.1
   length headers, since a length byte is as flippable as any other, but corrupting one is not
   the same as building a message whose lengths and nesting are internally consistent and
   different. A parser can reject the first at the door and still be wrong about the second. Out
   of scope too: any mutation outside the TSTInfo, and any fixture other than the one detached
   CMS both of them run against.
5. **The `--json` contract is prose plus tests**, not a machine-checked schema.
6. **Cross-format agreement is asserted on one scenario.** Invariant 8 covers an expired signer
   with a trusted stamp, which is the case that was actually wrong (C4). Agreement across the
   other combinations of trust and time state is expected and untested. Closing this means a
   parameterised table over those states, not another single case.
7. **Resource exhaustion is uncharacterised.** Nothing in this library bounds oversized or
   deeply nested input, whether ASN.1, PDF or XML. The sweep demonstrates robustness under
   bounded, length-preserving corruption, which says nothing about a gigabyte file or a
   thousand-deep nesting. The MCP server mitigates downstream with a subprocess timeout. The
   library itself does not.
8. **The signing side has no page like this one.** This page covers the verifier, as its title
   says. How a signature is written, which is where the PIN, the staging file and the access
   control of the replaced output live, is documented in the code and covered by regressions of
   the same kind, including several that came from the same reviews. It has no matrix, no
   clause mapping and no searching check, so nothing here should be read as evidence about it.
